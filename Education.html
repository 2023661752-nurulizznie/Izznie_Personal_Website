         <h3>Internship (2025)</h3>
         <p>Internship at PKINK — at first, I really thought I wasn’t going to enjoy it, but that feeling only lasted for the first week. After that, I actually started to love the whole experience, and I knew I was going to miss it when it ended. I got to try so many things I had never done before, like preparing cheques and handling filing, and it turned out to be so much fun. What made it even better was having officemates who were genuinely fun to be around and always there to help whenever I didn’t understand something</p>
