            <p>This was our ENT300 project, and we decided to sell hair clips. It was actually really fun experience because even though it was tiring, we still managed to make a profit.</p>

            <p>This was my first time getting hands-on with Adobe Premiere Pro for my practice. Before this, I only watched my brother use it, he’s the one who’s always into video editing and it is actually quite fun if you know how to actually use it.</p>

            <p>Finally! I bought the iPad I’d been dreaming about for so long. It’s pink-of course!, and it’s a birthday treat, Though I mainly need it for college, I’m definitely going to use it for movie marathons too hihi.</p>

            <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">- Joining Event -</h3>
            <p>This was my first time joining Cik Siti’s event (iykyk) and selling there with my friend during semester break. I’d never experienced selling in real life, particularly in F&B. It was definitely tiring, with some overtime involved but it was worth it because if not, i wouldnt get to know these people that are truly kind to me during the event, and personally I loved every moment of it.</p>
